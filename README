### Reinventing the Wheel

PPM was born out of a frustration for the volatile consumer culture engulfing the modern American software industry.  Startup culture has forgotten the ways of longevity and consistency, to the point that incompatible political agendas become mixed up into the technology stack, causing a sense of pride in its gait.  

PPM is "sophware" - deriving from the Greek word "soph" for _wisdom_.  There are no political agendas here, only a philosopher's notions as they pertain to the building of lasting software.  

The ultimate philosophy embodied by PPM is the wisdom of #simplicity#.  This means the PPM is meant to be terse (i.e. not have a lot of available options).  This means PPM is meant to accomplish essential tasks.  I didn't want to spend all of my time developing PPM!!  It is a tool :)

PPM is a tool for a specific niche of software developers.  It's a dependency management tool which is aimed at developers who also build their own dependencies for their own projects!!  OMG!  It's a tool for software developers who are in the business of *Reinventing the Wheel*.

### Prerequisites:
- PPM is tightly coupled with Git, so you must be using Git to backup and retrieve your projects.  This is because Git has such a powerful command-line API.
- PPM is not meant to be a permanent solution for anyone.  In fact it espouses the "DIY" mentality so it is meant to be learned from, while using it.  This is a good practice because it will give you good ideas for what you'd like to have in your own personal project manager (ppm ;P).

### Reinventing the Wheel
There's a general consensus among developers that it is bad to "reinvent the wheel".  This is a total scam and is a viewpoint they were sold early enough in life that it has become a "forsaken truth" - meaning that nobody even really analyzes the phrase any more because it _just is true_.  This is not true.  In fact, mankind has been literally "reinventing the wheel" since the dawn of time.  If nobody had thought to improve the car tire as new technologies/materials became available, we would have very poorly designed tires.  

The truth is, there are big businesses who make a lot of money reinventing the wheel.  It is a thought that the imperative to "don't reinvent the wheel" has come as a subtle form of suppression and therefore is oppressive.  

We decide to use everything which is already there and simply tie it all together to make bigger things.  But these bigger things don't last and they won't teach you.  Aren't you more likely to trust a TDM who has coding know-how?
